<h5>Advanced Query/Category Tips and Tricks</h5>
<p>This section will detail some tips and best practices on the art of Query/Category
building to help you get the most out of VoiceBase’s powerful Voice Analytics
tools.
Query WHERE Clause Tips
When you want to search your Media data for specific terms and phrases, the
WHERE clause is how you will do that. As a reminder, the WHERE clause looks like
this:
SELECT mediaId, hits()
FROM media
WHERE "Agent" SAYS "may be recorded"/1
LIMIT 100
Eventually, when you want to start building robust and comprehensive Categories,
one way you can do so is by chaining together a series of search terms and
phrases using the WHERE clause. When you do this approach, it is recommended
that you search for phrases that are no more than 2-3 words long, and that you use
the wildcard and slop capabilities of VBQL to anticipate variance in words, tenses
and different speech patterns.
Let’s walk through what we mean with the following example:
SELECT *
FROM media
WHERE "Customer" SAYS (("price drop*"/2 || "price change*"/2) && ("refund*" ||
"reimburs*"))
www.voicebase.com | support@voicebase.com 43
Let’s break down each part of this Query:
The SELECT Statement
This SELECT statement is selecting all available columns/Fields that we have setup
in our VoiceBase system.
SELECT *
The FROM Statement
This FROM statement is selecting all available Media files from our default Media
database called ‘media’.
FROM media
The WHERE Statement
WHERE "Customer" SAYS
(
("price drop*"/2 || "price change*"/2) && ("refund*" || "reimburs*")
)
Note: We’ve added some additional spacing to the WHERE clause from before to
show more clearly all that is happening. This extra ‘whitespace’ is ignored by the
Analytics workbench, so if writing your Queries and Categories this way is easy for
you, then feel free to space things out to show nesting more clearly!
This WHERE statement is saying the following:
- When a Customer says any of the following things, then that Media file is
qualified as a result for this query:
o The following rules are first grouped in a parenthesis so that the
Customer has to say at least one phrase from this group (which we will
dive deeper into below):
("price drop*"/2 || "price change*"/2)
AND at least one phrase from this group (which we will also dive deeper
into below):
("refund*" || "reimburs*")
Finally, the customer must say the qualifying phrases in the same speaking
turn (meaning before the agent speaks again) because it is using the
‘&&’ operator.
o Then, diving deeper into this sub-group:
("price drop*"/2 || "price change*"/2)
the customer must say either:
▪ ‘Price drop’, ‘price drops’, ‘price dropping’, ‘price dropped’, ‘price
may have dropped’, ‘price has dropped’, etc.
● This is due to using the Wildcard at the end of ‘drop’ which
tells VoiceBase to search for any endings and tenses for
the word ‘drop’.
● This is also due to the ‘/2’ Slop indicator, telling VoiceBase
to search for any phrases up to 4 words long, where up to
two of the words are unknown and may be between or
around the words ‘price’ and ‘drop’
▪ OR (because of the ‘||’) ‘Price change, ‘price changes, ‘price
changing, ‘price changed, ‘price may have changed, ‘price has
changed, etc.
● This is due to using the Wildcard at the end of ‘change’
which tells VoiceBase to search for any endings and
tenses for the word ‘change’.
● This is also due to the ‘/2’ Slop indicator, telling VoiceBase
to search for any phrases up to 4 words long, where up to
two of the words are unknown and may be between or
around the words ‘price’ and ‘change’
o Finally, diving deeper into this sub-group:
("refund*" || "reimburs*")
www.voicebase.com | support@voicebase.com 45
the customer must say either:
▪ ‘refund’, ‘refunds’, ‘refunding’, ‘refunded’, etc.
● This is due to using the Wildcard at the end of ‘refund’
which tells VoiceBase to search for any endings and
tenses for the word ‘refund’.
▪ OR (thanks to the ‘||’) ‘reimburse’, ‘reimburses’, ‘reimbursing’,
‘reimbursed’, etc.
● This is due to using the Wildcard at the end of ‘reimburs’
which tells VoiceBase to search for any endings and
tenses for the word ‘reimburs’.
Note: in this case, due to the way the word ‘reimburse’ works in
English, the ‘e’ is left off the end since depending on the
tense of the word, the vowel may be an ‘e’ or an ‘i’ in the
transcript.
You’ll note that rather than write a series of phrases exactly as we’d expect them to
be said in the conversation, we instead used the WHERE clause to build smaller
keywords and phrases that could be combined in many ways.
We also utilized the flexibility of the Wildcard and Slop Operators to allow
VoiceBase to find as many variants of these keywords and phrases as possible,
without us having to write them all out or anticipate things like filler words and
regional speech patterns.</p>
