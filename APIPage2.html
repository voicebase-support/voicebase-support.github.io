          <h4>Why is PCI not detected on my test recording?</h4>
          <p>VoiceBase's PCI and SSN detectors are based on machine learned models of real calls where both a caller and an agent are audible. This gives higher reliability and adaptability to real world situations than deterministic models, but also means that for accurate results the audio being processed for PCI, SSN, or PII detection must be real, not a test audio. An actual phone order may reflect some amount of conversation, followed by a product and quantity, the agent giving a total, asking for the card type and number, expiration date and possibly CVV code, and this is the type of data the PCI and related detectors have been trained on. If a customer creates a test audio that may only include numbers being read without the context that would typically trigger the model, the PCI will probably not be successfully detected.</p>

          <h4>What is your output format for multi-channel?</h4>

           <p>The JSON transcript would be like the example below, where 'w' is the word or speaker, 'e' and 's' are timestamps, 'c' is confidence, 'p' is position in the transcript, and 'm' is metadata information ("turn" reserved for speaker switches). This is a simple transcript where the caller says hi, then the agent says hi. We also have txt, srt, and other formats, but JSON is used most often; you can parse it and store or redisplay to make it 'plain'.

         {
          "w": "caller",
         "e": 5560,
            "s": 5160,
            "c": 1,
            "p": 1,
            "m": "turn"
          },
          {
