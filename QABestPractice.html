Quality Assurance Best Practices
In this section, we will describe the recommended Quality Assurance process to
help you build reliable Queries and Categories that avoid false positives and
negatives.
Once you’ve built your first Queries and Categories, you will want to start
considering how to audit your Content to ensure it’s still providing you the insights
you’re looking for.
Below we will detail the recommended quality assurance process and best
practices to follow when reviewing your Content.
Content Auditing
Note: A general recommendation when building and auditing your Content, is to
build and test iteratively. This means test each part and then also test the whole
to ensure you can easily identify any issues in your Content.
For example, if you wanted to search for a phrase like ‘wheelchair repair’, you
should first create a Query for just the word ‘wheelchair’ and ensure it pulls up the
results that you’re looking for (number of hits, accuracy in the transcripts,
accuracy in the calls themselves). Then, create a Query for the word ‘repair’ and
ensure it too pulls up the results you’re looking for. Then finally create a Query for
the phrase ‘wheelchair repair’ and ensure it pulls up the results you’re looking for,
which should include the results from your previous two tests.
1. Pick a Query or Category to audit
2. Identify the Anchor Words in the Content and the variants
3. Run the Query and select 100 results
4. For each of the results selected:
a. Ensure that the selected Anchor Words appear in the Transcript (you
can use the search feature to do this quickly)
b. For each hit in the Media, listen to the call to ensure that the audio and
the transcript match
c. Be sure to listen for false positives: that is times when the Transcript
identifies the Anchor Word, and the audio does not
i. Out of the calls that you’re auditing, best practice is to have a 90
– 95% accuracy rate
d. Be sure to listen for false negatives: that is times when the Transcript
doesn’t identify the Anchor Word, but the audio indicates that it was
mentioned in the audio
i. False negatives are trickier to identify as you’re searching for
something that VoiceBase hasn’t found. This is where using

Indicative Language can be essential to understand the
difference between the call and the Transcript.
For example, if you audit one of your Queries that searches for the term
‘wheelchair’, and you hear a speaker say ‘please help me find a
wheelchair’, however, the transcription says: ‘please kelp forest
whales’, this can be an example of a false negative.
If you find a number of similar false negatives, meaning, multiple calls
where the transcription says ‘please kelp forest whales’ instead
what the audio says which is ‘please help me find a wheelchair’,
you may actually want to add the phrase ‘please kelp forest
whales’ as a search term in your Query/Category’s WHERE
clause.
e. This is an art as much as a science; if you are encountering a large
number of false positives, false negatives or mis-transcription, you may
want to increase the volume of calls you are auditing starting with
increasing to 150 calls reviewed (so 50 more than you’ve already
reviewed), then increasing to 200, then 250, etc.
5. For Content that registers many false negatives, false positives or
mis-transcriptions, it is also recommended that you have another employee
audit those Queries and Categories. This will provide another layer of quality
assurance and may indicate other false positive or false negative speech
patterns that need to be anticipated.
6. It is recommended that you perform a Content audit once every 45-60 days to
ensure that you’re Content is still tuned accurately. Any number of changes
can be introduced to your VoiceBase system to make your Content less
effective, including different customer speech patterns, different regional
dialects due to expanding market reach and improvements to VoiceBase’s
Voice Analytics detection engine. Therefore, anticipating and planning for
time to regularly audit your Content will ensure that VoiceBase is always
meeting your Voice Analytics goals.
